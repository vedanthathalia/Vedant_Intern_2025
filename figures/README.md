# figures/

This folder contains all generated figures from fine-tuned models, Nextstrain, and dataset analysis.

- all_hosts/ – host distribution figures  
- avian/ – avian-specific figures (ROC, UMAP, log-likelihoods)  
- other/ – figures for “other” host category  
- nextstrain/ – Nextstrain plots (distance boxplots, violin plots, wedges)  
- dataset/ – sequence length, amino acid frequency, HA subtype distribution, cluster sizes, and train/eval/test splits  
- 650M/, 35M/, 8M/ – results for ESM models of different sizes (ROC, log-likelihoods, embeddings)  
- AllM/ – comparisons across all models combined
